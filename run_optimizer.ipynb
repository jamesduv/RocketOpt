    "An 'x' above the shaded diagonal means the model on the diagonal depends on the output from the model to the left.\n",
    "An 'x' below the shaded diagonal would represent a cyclic dependence, meaning the models would need to be coupled or iteratively converged.\n",

    "However, this coupling is weak which is why it was not pursued for the simplified model here. \n",
    "Additionally, there is coupling between the heat transfer model and the thermochemical solver.\n",
    "The coolant stream mixes with the main fuel flow and raises its temperature, augmenting the heat release and post combustion state. \n",
    "This effect is ignored in the current model implementation.\n",
    "There is additional coupling between the stress model and the flow model as components under stress undergo displacement, altering the engine cross-section slightly. \n",
    "This would impact the flow but again, this is likely to be a weak coupling. "
